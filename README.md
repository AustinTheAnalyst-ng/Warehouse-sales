# WAREHOUSE_RETAIL_TRANSFER SALES
This data was sourced from KAGGLE for exploratory data analysis.
## OBJECTIVE
The sole objective was to find sales trend across the years by and the item type with the most revenue. 
## FINDINGS
-- I was able to see that there was outliers due to entry errors, which was treated by using the log transformation to reduce the effect of the outliers.
-- After enough exploratory I was able to ascertain the item with the most revenue by year and the total sales generated by each item.
-- And i went ahead to visualize the data using line,barchart,piechart and histogram.
